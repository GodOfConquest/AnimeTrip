If you have trouble finding new Anime and Manga welcome aboard. I had the exact same problem and used lot of different sites to find recommendations but it never really worked out. I used to have the same problem so I build AnimeTrip - A new way to find Anime and Manga you like... 

Here is a quick overview of features - 

Discovering Anime and Manga with a button click 
	Once you have added your tastes and to AT, you just got to press one button and poff you get manga - Too good to be true...

Maintaining a list - To-watch list , To-read list, Already-watched list and so on. 

	You can maintain your lists while reading the manga with the help of the toolbar so you won't have to visit else where to update your manga list.

Maintaining your own library of Anime and Manga. 
	If you like to re-read certain series and rewatch episodes add them to the library and you can find it easily.

Adding new Content for other Otakus. 
	Do a favor by adding stuff you found enjoying so that AnimeTrip stays Human -not Automatic...

and more to come. While you are using it mind to drop me a comment. And for all the Github folks the Repo is there to be forked so please help me improve AnimeTrip.
